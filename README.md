## Introduction
* **What is a Digital Estate?** A digital estate is essentially a collection of assets tied to a single user or digial property. An asset is either tangible (a file) or intangible (a collection of metadata).

* **What is a Digital Municipality?** A digital municipality is a collection of digital estates which are all governed under the same regulation code/law.

This collection of digital estates all reside within a common region of claimed territory governed by the municipality.

* **Who are Agents?** The agents within this system are government organizations, business organizations, users, and AI/bots.

Each agent has a principal estate and may own further estates.

## Establishment

Estates represent digtial localities by which assets are produced, stored, modified, and sold.

The locality is represented by a unique slug, by which the estate is located. The estate is also located in an area within the Blazed Nation, but this number is not required to locate an estate.

The areas of the Blazed Nation are as follows (From North to South):
1. [Area 1: Banking and Finance](https://blazed.city/explore?area=1)
2. [Area 2: Shopping and Retail](https://blazed.city/explore?area=2)

## Assets
An asset is property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies.

Assets are stored within rooms, which are in turn located within estates.

## Contracts
A contract is a legally binding agreement entered in by two or more agents (citizens, bots, and/or companies). A contract defines a period to which it is to be considered "active", the period may optionally be indefinite. A contract enforces a series of requirements or terms to be satisfied, and shall define penalty and/or nullification procedure, should the contract be terminated by either party. The contract will also define the payment terms and amount(s).
